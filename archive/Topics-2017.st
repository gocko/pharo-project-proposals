In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, 
exchanging objects within one Git repository. 
In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. 
This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, 
and even a Permanent Web. 
IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. 
IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.
IPFS right now is implemented as a server process in Go and allows the global file system to be mounted as a user 
space filesystem. In addition, the server provides an API.
A real integration of IPFS with Pharo would require a complete implementation of IPFS in Pharo 
(projects are already in early stages to implement it in JavaScript and Python).
But the client API allows us already now to do experiments and assess the usefulness of IPFS in the context of Pharo.

	goal: 'To analyze data, you need to get data in first. So, one may want to read - say -
a CSV, and have a number of heuristics, such as:
- autodetection of encoding
- autodetection of quotes and delimiter
- autodetection of columns containing numbers or dates
- the possibility to indicate that some markers, such as "N/A",
represent missing values
- the possibility to indicate a replacement for missing values, such
as 0, or "", or the average or the minimum of the other values in the
colums
See http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/io.html#csv-text-files for some examples.
It may be worth to consider making this into a sequence that is read and processed lazily, 
to deal with CSV files bigger than memory.
When data is finally in, usually the first task is doing some processing, inspection or visualization. 
The Smalltalk collections are good for processing (although some lazy variants might help), 
and Roassal and the inspectors are perfect for visualization and browsing.
It could be extended as follows: The second part comes the time when one wants to run some algorithm. 
While there is no need to have the fanciest ones, there should be some
of the basics, such as:
- some form or regression (linear, logistic...)
- some form of clustering (kmeans, dbscan, canopy...)
Another thing which would be useful is support for linear algebra, leveraging native libraries such as BLAS or LAPACK.
Ideally, I would include also some tutorials, for instance for dealing with standard problems such as Kaggle competitions. 
Here I think Smalltalk would have an edge, since these tutorial could be in the form of Prof Stef. 
Still, it would be nice if some form of the tutorials was also on the web, which makes it discoverable.

as explained here https://clementbera.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/introducing-immutability-in-the-cog-vm/.

It means that once marked as immutable objects cannot be modified and raise an error. 
For deep Virtual machine optimisations that fold stack elements, having strings as immutable objects is key. 
Now the core Pharo libraries may still use some mutable strings.
Therefore the core libraries of Pharo should be revisited to identify use of mutable structures.

Now we face several challenges:
	- Identification of part thats can be migrated to immutable objects.
	- Identification of patterns of potential problems.

In addition, there is a need to propose to the Pharo developers a way to take advantage of immutability. 
A typical example is the use of write barrier (to identify objects that changes and therefore should be 
committed to database). We need to explore the design of a frameworks to let the developer expresses what 
should be done when an immutable object detects an attempt to modify it.  
';

The student will 
	- study current Pharo libraries for use of literal objects such as strings
	- define solution to avoid the use of mutable objects (in particular strings)
	- present the results to the core development team
	- iterate and help integrating the good results :)
	- start designing a first write barrier frameworks

Containers is an existing effort to gather many of the existing collection developed individually and externally to Pharo into a single umbrella. The idea is to create a modular collection library for Pharo users. Containers’s goals is to develop new efficient, well-tested, well documented collections. 
Containers contains already Tree, Grid, SkipList, LinkedList, OrderedDictionary but there is a need to revisit them. 

Finally Pharo 6.0 comes with two powerful primitives: new object immutability primitives as well as ephemerons [Hayes97].

With such important primitives two tasks can be performed: 
	- design new weak collections taking advantage of ephemerons.
	- revisit and design new concurrent collections taking advantage of immutability.

Additionally to this development effort, the Scale library (https://github.com/guillep/Scale) has been developed to allow using Pharo from the command line for scripting purposes.
These tools proved useful to the pharo community, as they are used in many projects for e.g., building, deploying or testing. But also, they pushed the pharo infrastructure and took to the surface several problems present in the underlying core libraries that difficults the deployment and usage in typical unix-like environments.';
  goal: 'The main goal of this project is to enhance the command line management in pharo to enhance the user experience in unix-like environments. We identify several tasks for the student, that should be accomplished in the 12 week lapse:
  - Complete, Test and integrate a better alternative for command line parsing such as Clap (https://github.com/cdlm/clap-st)
  - fix working directory (pwd): today pharo uses the image directory as working directory, causing several glitches when the image is used from a differen directory.
  - fix logging: pharo logs nowadays in the directory where the image is. We should be capable to define wether the logging should happen depending on the distribution or the environment (e.g., /var/log).
  - fix general file management: pharo wrongly reads and writes files relative to its `working` directory.

In general terms these development tasks include implicitly their integration into the main development branch of Pharo. This means that the student will also communicate with the Pharo open source community and follow the community''s quality guidelines and process of integration and validation.

  - Good practices of deployment and building applications
