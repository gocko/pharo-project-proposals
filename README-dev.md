# Pharo Project Proposals - DEV

## Building

This project uses https://github.com/pharo-contributions/PharoPeople as a Page Generator.
But to simplify things, *pharo-project-proposals* uses a customized [PharoTopicsPageBuilder](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-project-proposals/blob/master/repository/PharoTopics/PharoTopicsPageBuilder.class.st).

This class is invoked automatically during Travis build. It is invoked from a [test class](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-project-proposals/blob/master/repository/PharoTopics/PharoTopicsTest.class.st#L12) (which is rather hacky).

The topics are generated, however the core [page.html](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-project-proposals/blob/master/page.html) as well as the [style.css](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-project-proposals/blob/master/style.css) are static files in the repo; notice only the `{{TOPICS}}` placeholder.

## Deployment

After Travis finishes its build, it copies the generated `Topics.html` to `gh-pages` branch of this repository and pushes it.

Once the push is made, it becomes available at http://gsoc.pharo.org/.

> Note. gh-pages' content is autogenerated -- if you make any changes by hand, they will be overriden after next build.

> Note. GitHub pages use caching so it may not be immediately available (it can take couple of minutes to clean up the caches).
