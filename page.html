    <h3 id="for-students">Information for Students</h3>

    <p>
    These ideas were contributed by our developers and users. They are
    sometimes vague or incomplete. If you wish to submit a proposal based
    on these ideas, you may wish to contact the developers and find out
    more about the particular suggestion you''re looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
    Being accepted as a Google Summer of Code student is quite
    competitive. Accepted students typically have thoroughly researched
    the technologies of their proposed project and have been in frequent
    contact with potential mentors. Simply copying and pasting an idea
    here will not work. On the other hand, creating a completely new idea
    without first consulting potential mentors is unlikely to work out.
    </p>
    <p>
    If there is no specific contact given you can ask questions on the
    general Pharo development list
