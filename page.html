<h1>Pharo GSOC 2019: Ideas List</h1>

<a href="http://www.pharo.org"><img src="http://www.pharo.org/files/pharo.png"/></a>
	
	<p>Welcome to the one-stop-shop for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">
	Google Summer of Code 2019</a> with Pharo Consortium aspiring to provide the ultimate 
	immersive programming experience. <a href="http://www.pharo.org">Pharo</a> is a pure 
	object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity 
	and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).</p>

<h2>A glimpse of Pharo</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Simple &amp; powerful language:</strong> No constructors, no types declaration, 
	no interfaces, no primitive types. Yet a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax fitting 
	in one postcard! Pharo is objects and messages <em>all the way down</em>. </li>
	
	<li><strong>Live, immersive environment:</strong> Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: 
	Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments, you will never be stuck in compiling 
	and deploying steps again!</li>
	
	<li><strong>Amazing debugging experience:</strong> The Pharo environment includes a debugger unlike
	anything you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution of methods, 
	create methods on the fly, and much more!</li>
	
	<li><strong>Pharo is yours:</strong> Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more than 100 
	contributors for the last revision of the platform and hundreds of people contributing constantly 
	with frameworks and libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-students">General Information for Students</h3>
	<p> Hello Pharo enthusiasts ! Thank you for your interest in Pharo Consortium. 
	The pre-requisites for applying include knowledge about object oriented programming, 
	basic idea about Pharo/Smalltalk syntax. The idea list for the possible projects is 
	a result of contributions from developers and users which might not be complete on 
	their own. As a prospective student, you should contact the developer and/or the project 
	maintainer, for further clarifications, discussions and the interest in the project 
	during the application period should be made pretty evident via your Github contributions 
	and interactions with the mentors (EMails, mailing lists, chat channels, etc.).
	If there is no specific contact given you can ask questions on the general Pharo development 
	list <a href="mailto:pharo-dev@lists.pharo.org">pharo-dev@lists.pharo.org</a>. 
	See the <a href="http://pharo.org/community">Pharo community page</a> for information 
	on available mailing lists and how to subscribe. Being accepted as a Google Summer of 
	Code student is quite competitive. Accepted students typically have thoroughly researched 
	the technologies of their proposed project and have been in frequent contact with potential mentors. 
	Simply copying and pasting an idea here will not work. On the other hand, creating a completely 
	new idea without first consulting potential mentors is unlikely to work out as well.</p>
	
<h3 id="adding-a-proposal">Adding a proposal as a mentor</h3>
    <p>In case you are a Pharo developer and have a compelling idea for this year's Google Summer of Code, 
	we shall be happy to include your proposal to the list. Kindly add your project idea to the list of 
	topics in the following template on github (here at <a href="https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-project-proposals/blob/master/Topics.st">
	github.com/pharo-project/pharo-project-proposals/blob/master/Topics.st</a>) and send a pull request.</p>
    <code><pre>
     PharoTopic new
       title: 'name of your project';
       contact: 'email address';
       supervisors: 'mentor(s) names';
       keywords: 'keywords separated by spaces';
       context: 'description of the context of the project';
       goal: 'description of the goal';
       level: 'beginner, or intermediate, or advanced';
       yourself.
